        "\n",
        "1. **Basic Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN):** A straightforward approach would be to use the TF-IDF vectors you've created as input to a simple feed-forward neural network. This network could have a few fully connected layers followed by a final output layer with a sigmoid activation function (since this is a binary classification problem). The downside of this approach is that it doesn't consider the order of words in the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM):** These types of networks are designed to work with sequence data like text. Instead of TF-IDF vectors, you would convert your text into sequences of word embeddings (you can use pre-trained embeddings like GloVe, or train your own). These sequences would then be fed into the RNN or LSTM. These models can capture the order of words in the text, but they can be more complex and computationally intensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Transformers:** These are currently state-of-the-art for many text classification tasks. Transformers use a mechanism called attention to weigh the importance of different words in the text. There are many pre-trained transformer models available (like BERT or RoBERTa) that you can fine-tune on your specific task. This can often give you the best performance, but these models can be quite large and require a lot of computational resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each of these approaches, we would:\n",
        "- Define your model architecture in PyTorch.\n",
        "- Define a loss function (like binary cross entropy for binary classification).\n",
        "- Choose an optimizer (like Adam).\n",
        "- Then train your model using your training data, and evaluate it using your testing data."

        "**Why Using a Transformer Model is a Good Idea in This Case:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Transformers, specifically models like BERT, have been very effective for a wide range of NLP tasks, including text classification. Here are some reasons why transformers are a good choice:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Pretrained Models:** Transformer models can leverage pre-trained models which have been trained on large corpora like the entire Wikipedia text and BooksCorpus. This means they have already learned a rich representation of language, including understanding of syntax and semantics, even before being fine-tuned on a specific task like spam detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Contextual Word Representations:** Unlike word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe which provide the same vector for a word regardless of its context, transformers provide context-dependent word representations. This means the transformer can understand that the word \"bank\" in \"river bank\" and \"bank account\" have different meanings.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Attention Mechanism:** The transformer's attention mechanism allows it to focus on different parts of the input when producing the output, which can be particularly useful for understanding the importance of different words or phrases in the email text.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Positives of Transformers:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. State-of-the-art performance on many NLP tasks.\n",
        "2. Ability to handle long-term dependencies in text.\n",
        "3. Contextual word representations enable nuanced understanding of language.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Negatives of Transformers:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. High computational requirements. Transformers, especially models like BERT, have a large number of parameters and can be computationally intensive both in terms of memory and time.\n",
        "2. They can be overkill for simple tasks or small datasets where simpler models may perform just as well.\n",
        "3. Require careful preprocessing of text data to match the format of the pre-training data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Transfer Learning:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Transfer learning is a method where a pre-trained model is fine-tuned for a specific task. For example, BERT is pre-trained on a large corpus of text, then fine-tuned for tasks like text classification, named entity recognition, or question answering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Transfer learning has been a major driver of success in deep learning because it allows us to leverage large amounts of unsupervised data to learn useful representations, and then fine-tune those representations with a smaller amount of supervised data for a specific task."

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered this fund which resulted from grossly over - invoiced contracts which were executed for the FMW&H during the last administration.The companies that executed the contracts have been duly paid and the contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$21.4 Million floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for payment.I have therefore  been mandated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel to look for an overseas partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US21.4 legally subcontracting the entitlement to your company.This is bearing in mind that our civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign companies or operating foreign accounts while in government service, hence the need for an overseas partner.We have agreed that the funds will be shared thus after it has been paid into your account.\n",

( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources ( e . g . connect wordnet to celex ) , what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . draft program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza louise guthrie roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum paper submission - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - formatting guidelines : papers should not exceed 4000 words or 10 pages . hard copies : three hard copies should be sent to : gill callaghan , fao yorick wilks dept . computer science university of sheffield regent court 211 portobello st . , sheffield s1 4dp uk electronic submission : electronic submission will be allowed in poscript or html . an ftp site will be available on demand . authors should send an info email to ( yorick wilks ) even if they submit in paper form . an electronic submission should be accompanied by a plain ascii text . # name : name of first author # title : title of the paper # pages : number of pages # files : name of file ( if also submitted electronically ) # note : anything you 'd like to add # keys : keywords # email : email of the first author # abstr : abstract of the paper # . . . . . . important dates paper submission deadline ( hard copy / electronic ) february 15th 1998 paper notification april 1st camera - ready papers due may 1st dalr workshop may 27st\n",

- ( 04 - 05 ) 18 : 08 pdt here is the text of gov . gray davis ' televised speech on energy thursday , as prepared for delivery : \" good evening . i ' m speaking to you tonight from sacramento on the most difficult issue facing california : our energy crisis . \" simply stated , we have two problems : supply is too low and costs are too high . both result from the flawed deregulation scheme created in 1996 . but no matter how we got into this mess , you hired me to solve problems . and that ' s what i ' m doing . \" the only long - term solution is to build more power plants . we must also cut back on consumption and stabilize the utilities . but prices won ' t fall and supply won ' t be truly reliable until we generate more power than we consume . \" yet in the 12 years before i took office , not a single major power plant was built in california . not one . since i became governor , we ' ve licensed 12 major power plants . ten more are in the pipeline . and we ' re doing this without weakening our commitment to clean air and clean water . \" deregulation required the utilities to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating companies . the generators are free to charge whatever they want because they ' re governed only by federal regulators who refuse to control wholesale energy prices . \" this past winter , the prices charged by the generators shot through the roof , driving the utilities to the brink of bankruptcy . \" in january , with the feds still refusing to do their job , california stepped in to purchase the power the utilities could no longer afford to buy . we didn ' t take over to save the utilities . we took over to keep the power on and the economy strong . that ' s not all : - - we also negotiated long - term contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices . - - i used my emergency powers to seize control of low - cost power contracts the utilities were about to forfeit to the generators . - - we began negotiations to buy the utilities ' transmission system . - - we cut red tape and offered cash incentives to speed up construction of power plants . - - we ' re launching an $ 800 million conservation program . - - we ' re moving to establish a public power authority to build more power . if the private sector fails to build all the plants california needs , we ' ll build them ourselves . - - and because i share your concern that the generators are ripping us off , we ' re using every legal remedy to root out and punish illegal conduct . \" we can ' t fix 12 years of inaction overnight . but we ' re making real progress . \" now , as you know , i have fought tooth and nail against raising rates . it ' s become increasingly clear , however , that with rising natural gas prices , the feds ' failure to control costs , and the state ' s lack of supply , that some rate increases are needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong . \" but i remain committed to protecting average californians from massive rate hikes . so i ' m urging the public utilities commission to adopt a plan that will protect average consumers , reward those who conserve and motivate the biggest users to cut back . \" under my proposal , more than half of you won ' t pay a penny more . for the rest , the average increase will be 26 1 / 2 percent . for many of that group , rates will rise only about 10 percent . the heaviest users will see their rates rise 34 1 / 2 percent on average . that includes business paying their share . this is in addition to the 9 percent surcharge we ' ve all been paying since last winter . \" but all californians can reduce their bills through conservation . \" here ' s the point : the more you use , the more you pay . the more you conserve , the more you save . conservation is our best short -
